# CS 230 Project- Draw it or Lose it

## Summary  
The client, **The Gaming Room**, wanted to expand their Android   game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based, cross-platform version. The software needed to be scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.    
### 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.  
The client was *The Gaming Room*, who wanted to expand their Android trivia game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based, cross-platform version. They required unique names for games, teams, and players, multiple teams with multiple players, and only one game instance running at a time.  

### 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  
I successfully structured the design document clearly, ensuring that the technical details were conveyed in a way which meant the client and developers understood it.  This showed how the design met the client’s needs. 

### 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?  
The design document served as a roadmap that reduced confusion and guided development. Mapping out requirements and diagrams first made coding smoother and more focused.  

### 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
I would revise the sequence diagrams to include more detail on error handling and alternate paths. This would make the design more realistic and useful for implementation.  

### 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
I considered scalability, security, and fair gameplay and built these into the project with unique name checks and cross-platform functionality.  In technology, it is very important to keep the user in mind. If the user thinks the software will not suit their needs or expectations, it is unlikely to be very effective or achieve successful outcomes.

### 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  
I used UML diagrams and object-oriented design principles like inheritance and encapsulation. In the future, I would continue using these strategies while adding Agile feedback loops to gather user input earlier and refine designs faster.
